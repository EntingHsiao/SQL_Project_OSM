# SQL Project - OpenStreetMap Data 

In this project, I created the database with the cleaned CSV files and conducted SQL queries to perform a statistical analysis of Boston's OpenStreetMap(OSM) data. The clean data is forked from [MohamadZein](https://github.com/MohamadZeini)'s repository. 

## Map area : Boston, Massachusetts, USA
